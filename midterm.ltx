\section{Answer all of the following short questions.}
\subsection{Answer the following for the set $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.}
\subsubsection{Write two $3$-permutations of $S$ that are the same $3$-combination.}
\subsubsection{Write two $3$-permutations of $S$ that are the same cyclic $3$-permutation.}
\subsubsection{Write a $5$-permutations of $S$ that is a derangement of $S$.}
\subsubsection{Using the known formulas, count the total number of $3$-permutations, $3$-combinations, cyclic $3$-permutations, and derangements of $S$. Label each clearly.}


\subsection{Answer the following for the multiset $T = \{3 \cdot a, 3 \cdot b, 4 \cdot c\}$.}
\subsubsection{How many permutations of $T$ are there?}
\subsubsection{How many $3$-combinations of $T$ are there?}


\subsection{How many people are required to guarantee that two are born on the same day?}


\subsection{A group of $4$ men and $6$ women is to form a committee consisting of $5$ members.}
\subsubsection{How many committees can be formed?}
\subsubsection{How many committees can be formed if there must be at least $2$ men or at least $2$ women?}


\subsection{}
\subsubsection{Find the coefficient of the $x^6$ term of $(x-2)^7$ using the binomial theorem.}

\subsection{How many integers between $1$ and $200$ are not divisible by $3$, $5$, and $7$?}


\subsection{Prove that for all real numbers $r$ and integers $k$ the following relationship holds:}
\begin{align*}
  {{-r} \choose {k}} &= (-1)^k {{r + k - 1} \choose {k}}\\
\end{align*}

% \subsection{}
% \subsubsection{State the binomial theorem.}
% \subsubsection{Provide an algebraic proof that $\sum\limits_{k=0}^n{\frac{{n \choose k}}{k + 1}} = \frac{2^{n+1} - 1}{n + 1}$.}
