\problem{2}{
  Concerning Application 5, show that if $100$ integers are chosen from $\{1, 2, \ldots, 200\}$ and one of the integers chosen is less than $16$, then there are two chosen numbers such that one of them is divisible by the other.
}


\problem{8}{
  Use the pigeonhole principle to prove that the decimal expansion of a rational number $m/n$ eventually is repeating. For example,
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{34478}{99900} = 0.345125125125\cdots.
  \end{align*}
}


\problem{15}{
  Prove that, for any $n+1$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n+1}$, the exist two of the integers $a_i$ and $a_j$ with $i \ne j$ such that $a_i - a_j$ is divisible by $n$.
