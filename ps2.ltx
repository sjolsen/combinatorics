\problem{2}{
  Concerning Application 5, show that if $100$ integers are chosen from $\{1, 2, \ldots, 200\}$ and one of the integers chosen is less than $16$, then there are two chosen numbers such that one of them is divisible by the other.
}
Let $S$ be a set of $100$ integers chosen from $\{1, 2, \ldots, 200\}$ and indexed by some set $J$. Further, suppose $S$ has some element $x$ less than $16$. Each element of $S$ may be written in the form $2^k \times a$, where $k$ is a nonnegative integer and $a$ is odd; let $k_i$ and $a_i$ denote this $k$ and $a$ for each $s_i$ in $S$, respectively.

Consider whether there exist distinct $i, j \in J$ such that $a_i = a_j$:
\begin{caselist}
  \case{yes ($\qsome{i,j\in J}{a_i=a_j}$)}{
    Consider whether $k_i \ge k_j$:
    \begin{caselist}
      \case{yes ($k_i \ge k_j$)}{
        Because $k_i \ge k_j$, there is some nonnegative integer $d$ such that $k_i = k_j + d$. Then,
        %%% FIXME: Center
        \begin{align*}
          s_i &= 2^{k_i} \times a_i\\
              &= 2^{k_j + d} \times a_i\\
              &= 2^{k_j + d} \times a_j\\
              &= 2^d (2^{k_j} \times a_j)\\
              &= 2^d s_j.
        \end{align*}
        Because $d$ is a nonnegative integer, so is $2^d$; then, $s_j \divides s_i$.
      }
      \case{no ($k_i \ngeq k_j$)}{
        Because $k_i \ngeq k_j$, $k_j \ge k_i$; by congruent reasoning to the above, $s_i \divides s_j$.
      }
    \end{caselist}
    In either case, there are two chosen numbers such that one divides the other.
  }

  \case{no ($\nqsome{i,j\in J}{a_i=a_j}$)}{
    There are no two $i, j \in J$ such that $a_i = a_j$, so there are $100$ distinct $a_i$. Then, because there are $100$ odd numbers in $\{1, 2, \ldots, 200\}$, each such odd number appears as exactly one $a_i$.

    Consider the following exhaustive cases of $x$:
    \begin{caselist}
      \case{$x \in \{1\}$}{
        $x$ divides every other element of $S$; pick one.
      }
      \case{$x \in \{3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\}$}{
        $13x$ is odd, greater than $15$, and less than $200$; therefore, there is some $i$ such that $s_i = 2^{k_i} \times 13x$, and thus that $x \divides s_i$.
      }
      \case{$x \in \{2, 4, 8\}$}{
      }
      \case{$x \in \{6, 10, 14\}$}{
      }
      \case{$x \in \{12\}$}{
      }
    \end{caselist}
  }
\end{caselist}


\problem{8}{
  Use the pigeonhole principle to prove that the decimal expansion of a rational number $m/n$ eventually is repeating. For example,
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{34478}{99900} = 0.345125125125\cdots.
  \end{align*}
}


\problem{15}{
  Prove that, for any $n+1$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n+1}$, the exist two of the integers $a_i$ and $a_j$ with $i \ne j$ such that $a_i - a_j$ is divisible by $n$.
