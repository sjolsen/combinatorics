\problem{1}{Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.}
\subproblem{a}{How many $3$-permutations of $S$ are there?}
The number of $3$-permutations of a $6$-set is given by
\begin{align*}
  P(6, 3) &= 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4\\
          &= \answer{120}.
\end{align*}

\subproblem{b}{How many $3$-combinations of $S$ are there?}
The number of $3$-combinations of a $6$-set is given by
\begin{align*}
  {6 \choose 3} &= \frac{P(6, 3)}{3!}\\
                &= \frac{120}{6}\\
                &= \answer{20}.
\end{align*}

\subproblem{c}{How many cyclic $3$-permutations of $S$ are there?}
The number of cyclic $3$-permutations of a $6$-set is given by

  \frac{P(6, 3)}{3} &= \frac{120}{3}\\
                    &= \answer{40}.
\end{align*}



\problem{2}{Let $S = \{a, a, b, b, b, c\}$.}
\subproblem{a}{How many $3$-permutations of $S$ are there?}
Let $f(r,S)$ denote the number of $r$-permutations of the multiset $S$. Then,
\begin{align*}
  f(3,S) &= f(3,\{2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\})\\
         &= f(2,\{1 \cdot a, 3 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\})\\
         &+ f(2,\{2 \cdot a, 2 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\})\\
         &+ f(2,\{2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot b\})\\
         &= f(1,\{3 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\}) + f(1,\{1 \cdot a, 2 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\}) + f(1,\{1 \cdot a, 3 \cdot b\})\\
         &+ f(1,\{1 \cdot a, 2 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\}) + f(1,\{2 \cdot a, 1 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\}) + f(1,\{2 \cdot a, 2 \cdot b\})\\
         &+ f(1,\{1 \cdot a, 3 \cdot b\}) + f(1,\{2 \cdot a, 2 \cdot b\})\\
         &= (2 + 3 + 2) + (3 + 3 + 2) + (2 + 2)\\
         &= 7 + 8 + 4\\
         &= \answer{19}.
\end{align*}

\subproblem{b}{How many $3$-combinations of $S$ are there?}
\incomplete{
  Let $f(r,S)$ denote the number of $r$-combinations of the multiset $S$. Then,
  \begin{align*}
    f(3,S) &= f(3,\{2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot b, 1 \cdot c\})

\problem{3}{
  Use the pigeonhole principle to show that if there are $13$ students in a class then at least $4$ students get the same grade (assume the only grades assigned are A, B, C, D, or F).
}
This is not the case; it is possible, for example, for $3$ students to receive an A, $3$ students to receive a B, $3$ students to receive a C, $3$ students to receive a D, and one student to receive an F.

If, however, the only grades assigned are A, B, C, and F, we can interpret grades as boxes and students' individual grades as objects to be placed in those boxes. Then, by the strong form of the Pigeonhole Principle, in distributing $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 - 4 + 1 = 13$ objects into four boxes (that is, assigning one of four grades to each of $13$ students), we are guaranteed that at least four objects (students) are assigned to some box (grade).



\problem{4}{State the Binomial Theorem and use it to expand $(x+y)^3$.}
The Binomial Theorem states that for all positive integers $n$ and all $x$ and $y$,
\begin{align*}
  (x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n{{n \choose k}x^{n-k}y^k}.
\end{align*}
Then,
\begin{align*}
  (x+y)^3 &= \sum_{k=0}^3{{3 \choose k}x^{3-k}y^k}\\
  &= {3 \choose 0}x^{3-0}y^0 + {3 \choose 1}x^{3-1}y^1 + {3 \choose 2}x^{3-2}y^2 + {3 \choose 3}x^{3-3}y^3\\
  &= \frac{3!}{3!\,0!}x^3 + \frac{3!}{2!\,1!}x^2y + \frac{3!}{1!\,2!}xy^2 + \frac{3!}{0!\,3!}y^3\\
  &= \answer{x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3}.
\end{align*}



\problem{5}{Evaluate ${6 \choose 3\ 2\ 1}$.}
\begin{align*}
  {6 \choose 3\ 2\ 1} &= \frac{6!}{3!\,2!\,1!}\\
  &= \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{(3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) \cdot (2 \cdot 1) \cdot (1)}\\
  &= \frac{720}{6 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}\\
  &= \answer{60}.
\end{align*}



\problem{6}{
  $100$ people are surveyed and asked if they are planning on purchasing a laptop or a PC during the next year. Of the people surveyed, $40$ people are planning on buying a laptop and $30$ are planning on buying a PC, while $10$ are planning on buying both. State the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for $2$ sets and use it to determine how many people are planning on buying neither a laptop nor a PC.
}
The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle for two subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$ of $S$ is
\begin{align*}
  \card{\compl{A_1} \cap \compl{A_2}} &= \card{S} - (\card{A_1} + \card{A_2}) + \card{A_1 \cap A_2}.
\end{align*}
Then, if we let $S$ be the set of people surveyed, $A_1$ the set of those planning on buying a laptop, and $A_2$ the set of those planning on buying a PC, the number of people planning on buying neither a laptop nor a PC is given by
\begin{align*}
  \card{\compl{A_1} \cap \compl{A_2}} &= \card{S} - (\card{A_1} + \card{A_2}) + \card{A_1 \cap A_2}\\
  &= 100 - (40 + 30) + 10\\
  &= \answer{40}.
\end{align*}



\problem{7}{
  Determine the generating function and the exponential generating function for the sequence $\{1, 1, 1, 1, \ldots\}$. Make sure to label both.
}
The generating function for the above sequence is
\begin{align*}
  g(x) &= 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots\\
  &= \answer{\frac{1}{1-x}}.
\end{align*}
The exponential generating function is
\begin{align*}
  g^{(e)}(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty{\frac{x^n}{n!}}\\
  &= \answer{e^x}.
\end{align*}



\problem{8}{Answer the following for the sequence $h_n = n^2$.}
\subproblem{a}{Find the difference sequence of $h_n$ using $n \in \{0, 1, 2, 3 ,4\}$.}
We have
\begin{align*}
  \Delta h_n &= h_{n+1} - h_n\\
  &= (n+1)^2 - n^2\\
  &= (n^2 + 2n + 1) - n^2\\
  &= 2n + 1.
\end{align*}
Then,
\begin{align*}
  \Delta h = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots\}.
\end{align*}

\subproblem{b}{Using the $\nth{0}$ diagonal, determine the Stirling numbers of the second kind $S(2,0)$, $S(2,1)$, and $S(2,2)$.}
We have
\begin{align*}
  h &= \{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \dots\};\\
  \Delta h &= \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots\};\\
  \Delta^2 h &= \{2, 2, 2, 2, \ldots\};
\end{align*}
so
\begin{align*}
  S(2,0) &= \frac{0}{0!} = 0;\\
  S(2,1) &= \frac{1}{1!} = 1;\\
  S(2,2) &= \frac{2}{2!} = 1.
\end{align*}



\problem{9}{Find the Stirling numbers of the first kind $s(2,0)$, $s(2,1)$, and $s(2,2)$ by expanding $\fall{n}{2}$.}
We are given:
\begin{align*}
  \fall{n}{p} = \sum_{k=0}^p{(-1)^{p-k}s(p,k)n^k}.
\end{align*}
Then,
\begin{align*}
  \fall{n}{p} &= n(n-1)\\
  &= n^2 - n,
\end{align*}
so
\begin{align*}
  (-1)^2s(2,0)n^0 &= 0;\\
  (-1)^1s(2,1)n^1 &= -n;\\
  (-1)^0s(2,2)n^2 &= n^2
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
  s(2,0) &= 0;\\
  s(2,1) &= 1;\\
  s(2,2) &= 1.
\end{align*}



\problem{10}{
  Let $\mathcal{A} = \{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\}$, where

    A_3 &= \{a, d\};\\
    A_4 &= \{a, b, d\}.
