\section*{Chapter 3}
\subsection*{1. Concerning Application 4, show that there is a succession of days during which the chess master will have played exactly $k$ games, for each $k = 1, 2, \ldots, 21$. (The case $k = 21$ is the case treated in Application 4.) Is it possible to conclude that there is a succession of days during which the chess master will have played exactly $22$ games?}

\subsection*{2. Concerning Application 5, show that if $100$ integers are chosen from $1, 2, \ldots, 200$, and one of the integers chosen is less than $16$, then there are two chosen numbers such that one of them is divisible by the other.}

\subsection*{4. Show that if $n + 1$ integers are chosen from the set $\{I, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$, then there are always two which differ by $1$.}

\subsection*{9. In a room there are $10$ people, none of whom are older than $60$ (ages are given in whole numbers only) but each of whom is at least $1$ year old. Prove that we can always find two groups of people (with no common person) the sum of whose ages is the same. Can $10$ be replaced by a smaller number?}

\subsection*{11. A student has $37$ days to prepare for an examination. From past experience she knows that she will require no more than $60$ hours of study. She also wishes to study at least $1$ hour per day. Show that no matter how she schedules her study time (a whole number of hours per day, however), there is a succession of days during which she will have studied exactly $13$ hours.}

\subsection*{12. Show by example that the conclusion of the Chinese remainder theorem (Application 6) need not hold when $m$ and $n$ are not relatively prime.}

\subsection*{14. A bag contains $100$ apples, $100$ bananas, $100$ oranges, and $100$ pears. If I pick one piece of fruit out of the bag every minute, how long will it be before I am assured of having picked at least a dozen pieces of fruit of the same kind?}
