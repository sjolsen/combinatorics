\subsection*{1. For each of the four subsets of the two properties (a) and (b), count the number of four-digit numbers whose digits are either $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$:}
\subsubsection*{(a) The digits are distinct.}
\subsubsection*{(b) The number is even.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Case $\{\}$:

There are five possibilities for each of four independent digits; the number of possibilities is then $5^4$.
\item Case $\{a\}$:

There are five possibilities for the first digit. For each, there are four possibilities for the second; for each of these, three possibilities for the third; and for each of these, two for the last. Then, the number of possibilities is $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$.
\item Case $\{b\}$:

A number is even iff its last digit is even. Then, there are two possibilities ($2$ and $4$) for the fourth digit and five for each of the rest. This gives $5^3 \cdot 2$ possibilities.
\item Case $\{a, b\}$:

There are two possibilities for the last digit. For each, there are four possibilities for the third digit, for each of which there are three possibilities for the second digit, for each of which there are two possibilities for the third. Then, there are $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$ possibilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. How many distinct positive divisors does each of the following numbers have?}
\subsubsection*{(a) $3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^6 \times 11$}
Each divisor can be written as $3^i \cdot 5^j \cdot 7^m \cdot 11^n$, for some $0 \le i \le 4$, $0 \le j \le 2$, $0 \le m \le 6$, and $0 \le n \le 1$. There are $5 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 2$ such expressions. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, this is exactly the number of divisors.
\subsubsection*{(b) $620$}
The prime factorization of $620$ is $2^2 \times 5 \times 31$. By the above process, there are $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$ divisors.
\subsubsection*{(c) $10^{10}$}
The prime factorization of $10^{10}$ is $2^{10} \times 5^{10}$. By the above process, there are $11 \cdot 11$ divisors.

\subsection*{7. In how many ways can four men and eight women be seated at a round table if there are to be two women between consecutive men around the table?}
Choose some $m_1$ from the set of men. There are $12$ choices for seating $m_1$. For each, there are three seats in which the three remaining men may sit; then, for each seating for $m_1$, there are $3!$ ways to seat the men. For each way to seat the men, there are (from $8$ women and $8$ seats) $8!$ ways to seat the women. Thus, there are $12 \cdot 3! \cdot 8!$ ways to seat the party.

If seatings which differ only by rotation are considered equivalent, then there are $\frac{12 \cdot 3! \cdot 8!}{12} = 3! \cdot 8!$ ways to seat the party.

\subsection*{10. A committee of five people is to be chosen from a club that boasts a membership of $10$ men and $12$ women. How many ways can the committee be formed if it is to contain at least two women? How many ways if, in addition, one particular man and one particular woman who are members of the club refuse to serve together on the committee?}
There are ${12 + 10} \choose 5$ ways to form a committee of five with no restrictions on membership. Of these, ${12 \choose 0} \cdot {10 \choose 5}$ contain no women and ${12 \choose 1} \cdot {10 \choose 4}$ contain only one. Then, there are ${{12 + 10} \choose 5} - \left[ {{12 \choose 0} \cdot {10 \choose 5}} + {{12 \choose 1} \cdot {10 \choose 4}} \right]$ ways to form a committee of five with at least two women.

On a committee with $n$ women ($2 \le n \le 5$), there are ${12 - 1} \choose {n - 1}$ ways to choose the women such that the particular woman is on the committee; and ${10 - 1} \choose {5 - n - 1}$ ways to choose the men such that the particular man is on the committee. Since these are independent, there are ${11 \choose {n - 1}} \cdot {9 \choose {4 - n}}$ ways to form a committee with the particular man and woman. Thus, there are ${{12 + 10} \choose 5} - \left[ {{12 \choose 0} \cdot {10 \choose 5}} + {{12 \choose 1} \cdot {10 \choose 4}} \right] - \left[ \sum_{n=2}^5 {11 \choose {n - 1}} \cdot {9 \choose {4 - n}} \right]$ ways to form a committee meeting all restrictions.

\subsection*{11. How many sets of three integers between $1$ and $20$ are possible if no two consecutive integers are to be in a set?}

\subsection*{15. At a party there are $15$ men and $20$ women.}
\subsubsection*{(a) How many ways are there to form $15$ couples consisting of one man and one woman?}
\subsubsection*{(b) How many ways are there to form $10$ couples consisting of one man and one woman?}

\subsection*{17. In how many ways can six indistinguishable rooks be placed on a $6$-by-$6$ board so that no two rooks can attack one another? In how many ways if there are two red and four blue rooks?}

\subsection*{20. Determine the number of circular permutations of $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9\}$ in which $0$ and $9$ are not opposite. ({\it Hint}: Count those in which $0$ and $9$ are opposite.)}

\subsection*{21. How many permutations are there of the letters of the word ADDRESSES? How many $8$-permutations are there of these nine letters?}

\subsection*{24. A roller coaster has five cars, each containing four seats, two in front and two in back. There are $20$ people ready for a ride. In how many ways can the ride begin? What if a certain two people want to sit in different cars?}

\subsection*{28. A secretary works in a building located nine blocks east and eight blocks north of his home. Every day he walks $17$ blocks to work.}
\subsubsection*{(a) How many different routes are possible for him?}
\subsubsection*{(b) How many different routes are possible if the one block in the easterly direction, which begins four blocks east and three blocks north of his home, is under water (and he can't swim)? ({\it Hint}: Count the router that use the block under water.}

\subsection*{32. Determine the number of $11$-permutations of the multiset $S = \{3 \cdot a, 4 \cdot b, 5 \cdot c\}$.}

\subsection*{35. List all $3$-combinations and $4$-combinations of the multiset $\{2 \cdot a, 1 \cdot b, 3 \cdot c\}$.}

\subsection*{39. There are $20$ identical sticks lined up in a row occupying $20$ distinct places. Six of them are to be chosen.}
\subsubsection*{(a) How many choices are there?}
\subsubsection*{(b) How many choices are there if no two of the chosen sticks can be consecutive?}
\subsubsection*{(c) How many choices are there if there must be at least two sticks between each pair of chosen sticks?}

\subsection*{55. How many permutations are there of the letters in the words}
\subsubsection*{(a) TRISKAIDEKAPHOBIA?}
